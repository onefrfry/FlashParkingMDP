/*
  0. doing now: scrollable list with path arrows
 Things to get done:
    3.- Fix the bug where the map disappears when the back button is pressed
    1.- Make the directionalViewController actually update correctly for the directions the user has to go
    2.- Fix some of the UI issues
        - Button color being off
        - The inability to hit back with the "Find my Car" screen up
        - TableView shouldn't need to scroll and text boxes should be visible
 
    4.- Translation functions for images instead of characters
    6.- README file for the overall plan and future implementation stepss
